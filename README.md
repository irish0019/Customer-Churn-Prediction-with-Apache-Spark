# Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-Apache-Spark
Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction with Apache Spark

#Objective:
Build a customer churn prediction model using Apache Spark to identify customers at risk of leaving a subscription-based service (e.g., a mobile app, streaming service, or e-commerce platform).

#Project Description:

Data Preparation:

Acquire a dataset containing customer information, usage behavior, and historical churn data. You can use publicly available datasets or create a synthetic dataset.
Load and preprocess the data using Apache Spark, handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Feature Engineering:

Create relevant features that capture customer behavior and demographics, such as usage frequency, transaction history, customer tenure, etc.
Calculate churn labels based on historical data, where churned customers are those who canceled their subscriptions.
Distributed Computing with Spark:

Utilize Spark for distributed data processing and model training.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to build a churn prediction model.
Train the model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the results using tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

#Deployment:

Deploy the trained churn prediction model in a Spark-based environment for batch processing.
Create a script that takes new customer data as input and predicts the likelihood of churn.

#Benefits:

Identify customers at risk of churning early, allowing for targeted retention efforts.
Gain insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn, which can inform business strategies.
Improve customer retention rates and reduce revenue loss.
This project provides a practical introduction to customer churn prediction, a critical task for subscription-based businesses. It allows you to work with real-world data, perform feature engineering, and build a predictive model using Apache Spark.
